        <h1>JINJER Metal Band</h1>

        <p>
            Jinjer is a Ukrainian metalcore band from Donetsk, formed in 2008.
            None of the founding members remain with the band. The current
            lineup considers 2009 as its official year of formation, with the
            arrival of singer Tatiana Shmayluk and guitarist Roman
            Ibramkhalilov. The band has since added bassist Eugene Abdukhanov
            and drummer Vladislav Ulasevich. Their fifth studio album, Duel, was
            released in February 2025.
